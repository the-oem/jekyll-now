title: Turing School - Static Comp Challenge 1
---

This is the Static Comp Challenge 1 that was assigned during our 3rd week of class during Module 1 here at Turing. The idea being to recreate a static comp in HTML and CSS, keeping the layout the same but being given creative license on everything else. You can view screenshots of the static comp that was assigned and [my final version](https://the-oem.github.io/jc-comp-challenge-1/) of the assignment (shown below).
